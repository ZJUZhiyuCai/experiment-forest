# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs (Cloned)

## Process

1. **Understanding the idea**: Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea.
2. **Exploring approaches**: Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.
3. **Presenting the design**: Present in small sections (200-300 words), validating after each.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm.
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer.
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features.
- **Explore alternatives** - 2-3 approaches before settling.
- **Incremental validation** - Present in sections.
