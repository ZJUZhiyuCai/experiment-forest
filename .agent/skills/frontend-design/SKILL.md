# Frontend Design - 高级前端设计规范 (Cloned)

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, etc.
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful and unique. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow.
- **Visual Details**: Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, and dramatic shadows.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto) or cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white).
